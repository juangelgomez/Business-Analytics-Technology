## Business Analytics and Technology Course

### Introduction to GitHub
## **This is my first GitHub repository**

My name is Juan Angel Gómez, an eighth-semester *Business Administration* student and a monitor at the Office of Foreign Relations of the Universidad Externado de Colombia. I am currently pursuing the emphasis in "Business Analytics and Technology" and "Finance." I chose these emphases mainly due to my personal interest in new technologies, artificial intelligence, and my affinity for finance and financial analysis.  

In this repository, we explore the various tools that GitHub offers for creating and customizing repositories. The README file was written using Markdown syntax. This repository aims to:

1. Learn the basic functions of GitHub.  
2. Develop my profile for my professional future.  
3. Find repositories and sources of information for my personal projects.
